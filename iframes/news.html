                I'm incredibly excited to start my new job as a Software Developer/Analyst with
                The Dufresne Group. With some great people and a company I can be proud of, every 
                day is fun and there's always something new to learn.

                And that's the end of one Chapter of my life. I've finally finished my
                degree in Computer Science. Thank you to all those who have supported and 
                helped me succeed at the U of M. I'd like to specifically thank my family 
                for all the support they showed as well as Alan Marshall for being one of 
                the best teachers I had the pleasure of taking courses with. Finally I'd 
                like to thank my friends for giving me a safe place to be myself and 
                unwind.
            </p>

                My convocation is going to be on June 8th, 2017. Anyone who is in the 
                neighbourhood is welcome to come and help me celebrate the last five years of my
                life.
