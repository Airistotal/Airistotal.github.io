            I am currently accepting work programming any piece of software or doing any 
            kind of web development. My experience working at YogaLondon along with my 
            education has prepared me to work in several different capacities such as 
            project manager, software developer, app developer, and web developer. It 
            would be my pleasure to work doing these or other development jobs.
        </p>

            My primary language is C#, however I have experience in many different 
            languages including Java, Python, Ruby, and C++ to name a few. I have 
            developed a couple apps for Android devices in academic and personal 
            settings. With regards to web development, I have experience working in html, 
            css, javascript, php, mako templates, etc.
