            My name is Daniel Bouchard. I am Computer Scientist with my Bachelors of 
            Science, with an honours in Computer Science. I've successfully completed 
            several specializations:

            <ul>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Software Engineering</li>
                <li>Web-Based Systems</li>
                <li>Human-Computer Interaction and Graphics</li>
                <li>Computer Systems</li>
            </ul>

            Aside from my academics, I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing 
            people from the national microbiology lab plus I met people from all over 
            world during my time at YogaLondon.

            I have several personal projects including this website: renovating my parish
            website, an app that compares different vesions of the bible, and I've started 
            an organization called the Association of Computer Science Ethics (
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tAoCSE">tAoCSE</a>
            ). tAoSCE hasn't quite gotten off the ground yet, but I'm hoping that it will 
            grow over the next year into more than a one man team.
