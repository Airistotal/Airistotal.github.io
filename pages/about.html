            My name is Daniel Bouchard. I graduated from the University of Manitoba with
            my Bachelors of Computer Science (Honours). I've
            successfully completed several specializations:

            <ul>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                <li>Software Engineering</li>
                <li>Web-Based Systems</li>
                <li>Human-Computer Interaction and Graphics</li>
                <li>Computer Systems</li>
            </ul>

            Aside from my academics, I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing 
            people from the national microbiology lab, the Information Systems department
            at Dufresne, the RAPID RTC development team, plus I met people from all over
            world during my time at YogaLondon.

            I have several personal projects including this website: an app that compares 
            different vesions of the bible, a checkered board game portal and a stock ticker.
