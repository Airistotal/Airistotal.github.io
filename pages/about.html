    My name is Daniel Bouchard. I graduated from the University of Manitoba with
    my Bachelors of Computer Science (Honours). I've
    successfully completed several specializations:

    <ul>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Software Engineering</li>
    <li>Web-Based Systems</li>
    <li>Human-Computer Interaction and Graphics</li>
    <li>Computer Systems</li>
    </ul>

    Aside from my academics, I've been fortunate enough to work with some amazing 
    people from the national microbiology lab, the Information Systems department
    at Dufresne, the RAPID RTC development team, plus I met people from all over
    world during my time at YogaLondon.

      I have several personal projects including this website: an app that compares 
      different vesions of the bible, a checkered board game portal and a stock ticker.
