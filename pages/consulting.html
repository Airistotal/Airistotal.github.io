            I am currently accepting work programming software or doing web development. 
            I've got 4 years of experience doing software developement from start to finish.
            It would be my pleasure to work doing any development job that you can think of.
        </p>

            My primary language is C#, however I have experience in many different 
            languages including Python, Java, Ruby, and C++ to name a few. I have 
            developed a couple apps for Android devices in academic and personal 
            settings. With regards to web development, I have made many .net framework
            websites, vue.js websites, and obviously this website which is mostly based
            on jQuery.
